# Euro Stat Analysis
 Task to analyse the number of stays in EU and online user coverage.
 
 In order to find the best country for the business. We should calculate and maximize the potential profits.
If country has largest population and smallest user online then due to small user base it will not be possible to get high revenue.
If there is large online user base but country has small population then it is also cannot be high profit to extracted.
The best case is to have high population and also high online users percentage.

Assume, the Number of Bed-Places value is the maximum number available of places. 
Percentage of individuals online is the Market Share.
Suppose ideally all beds are allocated by customers in 1 day in 1 country and all customers are required to pay 1 dollar for wifi lamp usage.

The amount customers who will use the beds will be close to the percentage of individuals online Expected Value.
The maximum possible profit can be calculated as Number of Bed-places * (Individual online/100) * 1 dollar.
After calulcation we can see that UK yields a highest maximum possible profit in 1 day if all beds were allocated and the proportion of lamp usage was equal to online users.
